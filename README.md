# Intelligent-Health-Monitoring-and-Emergency-Response-System


This project introduces a groundbreaking Smart Health Monitoring and Rescue System designed specifically for mine workers, addressing the critical need for real-time health monitoring and timely intervention. The system integrates advanced sensors capable of monitoring vital parameters such as heartbreat trends, blood oxygen levels, electrical activity in response to nerveâ€™s stimulation and other environmental conditions within the environment. Leveraging cutting-edge technology, our solution employs artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze sensor data in real-time, identifying anomalies and predicting potential health risks.
	In the event of oxygen level deviations or adverse health trends, the system autonomously activates a rescue mechanism, releasing oxygen cylinders to ensure immediate and life-saving support for the affected worker. 
	This innovative Smart Health Monitoring and Rescue System not only enhances the safety and well-being of mine workers but also sets a new standard for intelligent, autonomous emergency response in challenging industrial environments.
